# Proof of Humanity + Anonymous Voting
Proof of Humanity and Anonymous Voting feature in Nounish DAO
With DAOs rising in popularity a lot of different government systems have been tested in different forms..
Most of them use ER20 Token based voting systems, and with Nouns DAO introducing NFT (ERC721) based voting, a lot of different organizations have adopted the “Nounish” DAO format.
One down side of the auction based NFT mint is the favoring of ETH whales, who can consistently outbid the competition. This leads to the possibility of a 51% attack.
Nouns DAO solves with the veto system.
Recently there have been different ideas of limiting the amount of tokens one person can obtain.
